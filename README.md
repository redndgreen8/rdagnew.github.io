## Overview

This repository contains a 3D interactive visualization built with R and Plotly that helps professionals effectively communicate their technical competencies in a visual, engaging format. Unlike traditional skills listings in resumes, this approach provides context around:

- **Years of Experience**: How long you've worked with each technology
- **Proficiency Level**: How skilled you are with each technology
- **Recency of Use**: How recently you've applied each skill

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization using Plotly
- Customizable skill categories with color coding
- Exportable to HTML for embedding in online portfolios
- Static version available for resume integration
- Easy data import from CSV or manual entry
